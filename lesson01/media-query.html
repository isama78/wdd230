            <p>27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their aweakness. I bgive unto men weakness that they may
                be
                humble; and my cgrace is sufficient for all men that dhumble themselves before me; for if they humble
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make eweak things become strong unto them.</p>
